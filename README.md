### Features:
- **Combinatorics**: Perform calculations related to permutations, combinations, and other combinatorial operations.
- **Logarithms**: Solve logarithmic equations efficiently.
- **Trigonometry**: Work with common trigonometric functions and identities.
- **Main Loop**: A centralized script to manage the function calls and user interaction.

### File Overview:
- `Combinatorics.py`: Functions related to combinatorics.
- `logarithims.py`: Contains logarithmic calculations.
- `trigonometry.py`: Trigonometric operations.
- `function_calls.py`: Manages the calling of different functions.
- `functions_list.py`: Lists and organizes available mathematical functions.
- `proprietry.py`: Proprietary operations (custom features).
- `mainloop.py`: Manages the overall flow and interaction in the app.
